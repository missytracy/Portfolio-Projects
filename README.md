# Selected Portfolio Projects

A collection of select data science projects.    

**1. Predicting Song Likeability Using Spotify Audio Features (Spotify)**
* Supervised learning capstone project.  I used Spotify's API to obtain song data from my personal account and used it to build a model that would predict whether or not I'd like a song based on audio features. 
* Project workflow divided in a three notebooks for better organization and data processing.  The bulk of the project is contained in 'Part III Modeling'.
* Presented workflow and results to Thinkful peers and instructors.  Powerpoint presentation is included.

**2. Natural Language Processing: An Exploration of Supervised and Unsupervised Methods**
* Used NLTK to process text data from Presidential State of the Union addresses.  Generated features using unsupervised methods (tf-idf, latent semantic analysis) to gain insights into text content and structure.  Built supervised learning models to predict source of text.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Salt Lake City Air Quality (Air Quality)**
* Exploratory data analysis of air quality metrics in Salt Lake City, UT between 2000-2017.
