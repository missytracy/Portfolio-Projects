# Selected Portfolio Projects

A collection of select data science projects.    

'Predicting Song Likeability Using Spotify Audio Features'
* Supervised learning capstone project as part of Thinkful's Data Science Bootcamp.  I obtained song information from my personal account using Spotify's Web API and used it to build a model that would predict whether or not I'd like the song based on audio features.   

'Data Exploration of Air Quality in Salt Lake City'
* Exploratory analysis of air quality metrics in Salt Lake City, UT between 2000-2017.
