# Portfolio Projects

A collection of independent data science projects from my time in the Thinkful Data Science Program.    

**1. Solar Stock Predictions**
* Time-series analysis and stock price forecasting for companies working within the solar energy market sector.  Analysis performed using ARIMA models and Facebook's Prophet forecasting tool.  I also created an interactive Tableau dashboard to play with the data.  Check it out here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/missy.tracy#!/vizhome/SolarInvestingDashboard/Dashboard1

**2. Predicting Song Likeability Using Spotify Audio Features**
* Supervised learning capstone project.  I used Spotify's API to obtain song data from my personal account and built a model that would predict whether or not I'd like a song based on audio features.  I also wanted to gain insights into my personal music preferences. 
* Project workflow divided in a three notebooks for better organization and data processing.  The bulk of the project is contained in 'Part III Modeling'.
* Presented workflow and results to Thinkful peers and instructors. 

**3. Natural Language Processing: An Exploration of Supervised and Unsupervised Methods**
* Used NLTK to process text data from Presidential State of the Union addresses.  Generated features using unsupervised methods (tf-idf, latent semantic analysis) to gain insights into text content and structure.  Built supervised learning models to predict source of text.

**4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Salt Lake City Air Quality (Air Quality)**
* Exploratory data analysis of air quality metrics in Salt Lake City, UT between 2000-2017.
